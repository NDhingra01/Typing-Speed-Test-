It all started in the 1860s. An amateur inventor, politician, printer and newspaper man in Milwaukee by the name of Christopher Latham Sholes, often spent his spare time tinkering with and creating new machines to make his businesses more efficient. The popular theory states that Sholes had to redesign the keyboard in response to the mechanical failings of early typewriters. The type bars connecting the key and the letter plate hung in a cycle beneath the paper. If a user quickly typed a succession of letters whose type bars were near each other, the delicate machinery would get jammed.
